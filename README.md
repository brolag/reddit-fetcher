## Project retrospective:

### Was 3 days/12 hours enough time? Why or why not.
R/ I think is enough time to have a MVP, but probably could take more time to refine details or refactor code.

### How many hours would you estimate you spent total on the project?
R/ I estimate around 10 to 12 hours.

### Did you encounter any struggles while completing this? How did you overcome them?
R/ I found some problems with PostCSS, specially while integrating it with Webpack, at the end I decided to not waste
more time up and continue with SASS.

### Do you have experience using SASS or PostCSS? If not did you look at it at all?
R/ I've worked with SASS but is the first time I use PostCSS, it's a great technology but in my opinion is too new, so
there might be some trouble trying to make it work in a project, so it requires time.

### Do you think that it’s something you could learn easily?
R/ Yes, for sure, actually I'll keep playing with it because it has a lot of potential.

### If you used a JavaScript library/framework, why did you choose it for this project? (Briefly detail for each one)
R/ I used redux promise in order to handle the promise of the request more easily. Also I', using axios for the request
to the Reddit endpoint, and finally I'm using Babel in order to use ES6 syntax.

## On a scale of 1 – 10, rate the complexity of this project
R/ I think is kind of a 4 to 5 because of the time and new technologies.
